Many people have wondered about my keyboard shortcuts. I like being able to accomplish most things without taking a long voyage to the mouse, or even worse a touchpad! So here's a list of the keyboard shortcuts I use:

Super + Down Arrow

Tile window on half of screen:
Super + Left/Right Arrow

Tile window on corner of screen:
Super + Left/Right arrow + Up/Down arrow
